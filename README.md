# Painter
A small painting program written in [Factor](https://factorcode.org/) using it's UI framework. Depends on my [Bresenham's Line Algorithm](https://github.com/Capital-EX/bresenham) vocabulary.

# Installing
Clone the repo into your `$FACTOR_ROOT/work` directory and run using `"painter" run` or `USE: painter run-painter`.
